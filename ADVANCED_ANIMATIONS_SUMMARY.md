## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

### 1. Progressive Enhancement
- **Performance Hook**: `usePerformanceOptimization.tsx`
  - Device capability detection
  - Reduced motion support
  - Battery level awareness
  - Network speed adaptation

### 2. Animation Preloading
- **Animation Preloader**: `AnimationPreloader.tsx`
  - Preloads GSAP and animation assets
  - Smooth transition to main content
  - Loading progress indication
  - Error handling for failed loads

### 3. Mobile Optimization
- **Responsive Animations**: All components include:
  - Reduced particle counts on mobile
  - Simplified effects for low-end devices
  - Touch-optimized interactions
  - Battery-conscious animations

### 4. Accessibility Features
- **Motion Preferences**: Respects `prefers-reduced-motion`
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements accessible
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and descriptions
- **Focus Management**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
