          At Brew & Bliss, sustainability is at the core of everything we do. We are committed to ethical sourcing, ensuring that our coffee beans are grown and harvested in an environmentally responsible manner, and that farmers receive fair compensation for their hard work.
        </p>
        <p className="font-body text-primary-dark/80">
          We actively work to reduce our environmental footprint through initiatives like composting coffee grounds, using recyclable and compostable packaging, and minimizing energy consumption in our shops. We believe that great coffee shouldn't come at the expense of our planet or its people.
